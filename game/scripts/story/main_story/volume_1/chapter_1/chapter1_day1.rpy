    "It wasn't the first time I'd been here."
    "In fact, I discovered this place {i}months{/i} ago."
    "I think it used to be a science lab or something?"
    "It's such a cool place to roam around. I've found some good loot here too."
    "Today, I decided to go further than I'd ever gone."
    "It was dark, so I had to use my flashlight."
    "As I got closer to the back of the facility, I felt increasingly nervous. It was like... something was off here, but I wasn't sure what."
    "I trudged on, through the puddles and broken bits and cobwebs."

    "The wires... were connected to her..."
    "My mind quickly joined the pieces."
    "She must be an Android."
    "I thought they were outlawed long ago... How does she still exist...?"
    "Curiosity got the better of me, and I approached cautiously."
