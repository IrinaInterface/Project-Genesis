    "It wasn't the first time I'd been here."
    "In fact, I discovered this place {i}months{/i} ago."
    "I think it used to be a science lab or something?"
    "It's such a cool place to roam around. I've found some good loot here too."
    "Today, I decided to go further than I'd ever gone."
    "It was dark, so I had to use my flashlight."
    "As I got closer to the back of the facility, I felt increasingly nervous. It was like... something was off here, but I wasn't sure what."
    "I trudged on, through the puddles and broken bits and cobwebs."

    "At the end of the long corridor was a singular door."
    "I hesitated. It felt like someone was pulling me away, telling me to go back now while I still can."

    "I pushed open the door."

    "The room was very bright. It took me a moment to adjust."
    "It was strange, really. The whole facility lost power years ago, or so I thought..."
    "As I ventured forward, looking around in awe, it became clear what this place really was."
    "{i}It was a testing chamber.{/i}"
    "Up ahead was a weird frame thing."
    "I approached with caution."

    "I could see a small girl, laying peacefully on a table."
    "The wires... were connected to her..."
    "My mind quickly joined the pieces."
    "She must be an Android."
    "I thought they were outlawed long ago... How does she still exist...?"
    "Curiosity got the better of me, and I approached cautiously."
    "She seemed to be asleep."
    "I was soon stood beside the table, watching her with a mix of awe and trepidation."
    "She seemed... sort of peaceful..."
    "What happened next, I'm still not sure how it did. It may have been impulse, or confusion making me act irrationally, I don't know..."
    "I reached out and touched her."
    "That's all it took."
    "In an instant, the system whirred to life, making me jump. I stumbled back in surprise and terror."
    "A bright ball of light appeared on the ceiling. It stayed floating for a moment, before suddenly bursting into many smaller balls and zooming down the wires of the mainframe."
    "All I could do was watch in utter bewilderment."
    "The light travelled down towards her, and upon reaching her began to surround her body in the pulsating brightness."
    "The more light that entered her, the faster the rhythm of the pulse, and the brighter the light. I ended up having to look away eventually, or I'd probably have went blind."
    "A loud bang."
    "Then silence."
    "I turned back around slowly, shaking, shocked from the whole ordeal."
    "She still seemed to be asleep."
    "I once again lost all rational thought and approached."

    "She sat up very suddenly. I screamed, stumbling back and tripping on a loose wire, making me fall over."
